## Notion Site Manager
The Site Manager tool takes pages built in Notion (using the Site Builder or standalone) where pages go live to the website once moved here.

See the Site Manager in Notion for tips, help info, and documentation.

The Site Manager is synced with the Super site at the root of the main site, so all new pages for the site must be children of the root page.
